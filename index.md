# About Me
I am a Computing Science Master's student at Radboud University with an ambition to partake in academic research to explore how technology can be used to improve society. Whether it is applying data mining techniques to suggest better metrics for welfare, addressing algorithmic bias or improving computing science education to prepare students for societal challenges, I aim to have a positive impact on the world by taking direct action in my near environment. With my proactive nature, I involve myself socially to contribute to an equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society. In my free time, I love to experience outdoor adventures through hiking or running and relax by reading books or playing the piano.
