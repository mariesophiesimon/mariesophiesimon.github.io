# About Me

<img src="/img/Marie-SophieSimon.png" alt="Marie-Sophie Simon profile picture" style="float: right; height: 200px">  
I am originally from Germany and studied **Computing Science** at Radboud University. There, I developed an ambition to explore how data and technology can be used to build a better and more just society. Whether it is through data mining to understand correlations, causal inference for policy advice or to design recommender algorithms that are fair, transparent and trustworthy. In my position as a PhD candidate at Utrecht University I will use my data science knowledge to explore the topic of **human-centered computing for education**. The goal of this research is to design applications that guide students in their learning process through personalized recommendations, and provide valuable information to teachers analyzing progress and preparing lessons.  

My research aims to have a positive impact on the world, while at the same time, keeping a practical, pragmatic approach that is applicable in real-life and takes society along. With my proactive nature, I involve myself socially to contribute to an **equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society**.
