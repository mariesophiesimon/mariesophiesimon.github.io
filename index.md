# About Me

<img src="/img/Marie-SophieSimon.png" alt="Marie-Sophie Simon profile picture" style="float: right; height: 200px">  
I am originally from Germany, studied **Computing Science** at Radboud University and have an ambition to explore how technology can be used to improve society. From September on, I will be doing this as a PhD student at Utrecht University on the topic of **human-centered computing for education**. I aim to have a positive impact on the world using ideology and research. At the same time, I aim to keep a practical, pragmatic approach that is applicable in real-life and takes society along. With my proactive nature, I involve myself socially to contribute to an **equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society**. In my free time, I love to experience outdoor adventures through hiking or running and relax by reading books or playing the piano.
